Summary:
1.	Is the result significant? No, the result is not significant (p-value = 0.4287).
2.	Do you accept or reject the null hypothesis? We fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is no significant difference in death rates between 1960 and 1993.
3.	What does the result mean in the wider context? The result suggests that there is no strong evidence for a significant difference in death rates between these two years, which could inform further analysis or suggest that other factors may be involved in the changes in death rates.
